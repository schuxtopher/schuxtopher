## Moin and hello ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an engineer from Germany with an interdisciplinary background in medical engineering, software development, and entrepreneurship. Iâ€™m driven by curiosity, learning and systems thinking.

Understanding why something brakes, optimizing for efficiency, and customizing systems to fit specific needs bring me a lot of joy. Taking things apart and reimagining them in innovative ways is what gets me excited. 

This page is where I plan, experiment and document my journey.

What really fascinates me about software development is the fusion of structure and creativity. Whether in personal projects, within a team, or as part of a company.

I love everything about Computers. The manipulation of data, creating complex interlocking systems or just a simple script. Thereâ€™s something almost magical about coding.

For me, coding, hacking, and engineering are not just handy skills but a way of life. Having fun with your craft is the secret ingredient for exceptional work and fruitful soil for innovation.

It never gets boring and there is always something new to discover.

Best,
Christopher


## A Little Disclaimer

My account got a bit dusty, and I decided it's time to resurrect it. I really love to tinker, and I kind of neglected that side of me during the end of my masterâ€™s degree.

I have a few plans for this repository in the future: I'd like to start something like a personal coding diary, share my dotfiles, and document small projects. This could include learning new programming languages or experimenting with ideas that catch my curiosity.

I want to make coding for fun a habit. Play and experimentation are the best ways to learn, stay engaged, and keep motivation alive.

I already have a small backlog of ideas but havenâ€™t decided on the order yet. Here are a few:

- **Book reviews:** Iâ€™m guilty of FOMO-buying Humble Bundle book packs, and many of them are still untouched. So, why not review them? Did they teach me something new? Were they tough to read or surprisingly fun? Would I recommend them? Iâ€™m also thinking about exploring some vintage computer science booksâ€”maybe Iâ€™ll find a forgotten gem worth sharing.
- **Rewriting old student projects:** Imposter syndrome is a common developer malady, and itâ€™s easy to overlook your own progress. Revisiting old code is a great way to internalize that you are improving, no matter your current level. Some of my medical engineering projects involved medical image processing in proprietary languages. Rewriting those in modern tools could be both nostalgic and educational.
- **Building my homelab:** I want to deepen my understanding of virtualization and containerization. The hardware is already there; now itâ€™s time to put it to use and try a few new services.
- **Keyboard tinkering:** Iâ€™m a keyboard enthusiast and love my Corne split keyboard. Iâ€™d like to refresh my knowledge of embedded systems, dive deeper into QMK, and learn more about microcontroller programming.
